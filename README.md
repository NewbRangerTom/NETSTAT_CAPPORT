Thank you to the original creators (see below) for this code.  I was looking for something like this to complete/compliment
a family gift project.

  For ESP8266 / ESP32 boards
  
  ESP_WiFiManager is a library for the ESP8266/ESP32 platform (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) to enable easy
  configuration and reconfiguration of WiFi credentials using a Captive Portal. Inspired by:

/****************************************************************************************************************************
   This example will open a configuration portal for 60 seconds when first powered up if the boards has stored WiFi Credentials.
   Otherwise, it'll stay indefinitely in ConfigPortal until getting WiFi Credentials and connecting to WiFi

   ConfigOnSwitch is a a bettter example for most situations but this has the advantage
   that no pins or buttons are required on the ESP32/ESP8266 device at the cost of delaying
   the user sketch for the period that the configuration portal is open.

   Also in this example a password is required to connect to the configuration portal
   network. This is inconvenient but means that only those who know the password or those
   already connected to the target WiFi network can access the configuration portal and
   the WiFi network credentials will be sent from the browser over an encrypted connection and
   can not be read by observers.
